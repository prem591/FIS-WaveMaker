## Prefabs


FIS Prefabs are reusable, production-ready components that implement consumer banking services using FIS Code Connect API.

Incorporating these prefabs into banking applications highly speeds up the development process by providing the functionality, so that you can focus on customizing the look and feel. They can also be used freely for different form factors such as desktop, mobile and tablet, as they have been configured to auto-adjust to fit the device being used.
